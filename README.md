#A simple and minimalist converter between numeral bases and text

##A fully functional converter between text, binary, hexadecimal, octal and decimal.

This simple project was made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This program has all its conversion types in a single page, and lets the user quickly alternate between conversion types without having to change pages. It comes in very handy when a quick conversion is required.

##How to run this project on your machine

There are three ways to achieve this

- Launching the HTML file (the simplest)

  1. Head to the top of the page and click on the green button to download the .zip file.
  2. Extract the downloaded folder and navigate inside it
  3. Launch index.html and enjoy!

- Using the live-server VS Code extension

  1. Head to the top of the page and click on the green button to download the .zip file.
  2. Extract the folder and open it in a new VS Code window.

- Using the live-server node package

  1. Head to the top of the page and click on the green button to download the .zip file.
  2. Make sure that you have node installed. To check this, open a new terminal window and type `node --version`. If the version number is displayed, you can continue to the next step.
